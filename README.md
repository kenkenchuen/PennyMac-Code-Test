Simply run by typing into terminal
```
python3 smallestTempSpread.py

python3 smallestForAgainstDiff.py
```

Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?
* Yes, I used my solution to the first program as the base for the second.
  The changes I made include not needing to strip non-numeric characters ('*' 
  in the first program), and taking the absolute value of the difference (as it is possible that number of goals scored *For* is less than *Against*).
